## Create package.json using npm init

to Install package use `npm install <package name>`

## Semantic Versioning
the basic standerd that node js use to versioning packages. that alloew us to know if the package is stable or not.
How versioning works:
`lodash: ^4.17.11` 
major.minor.patch
major: breaking changes - 4
minor: new features - 17
patch: bug fixes - 11
the `^` means that the package is stable and the `4.17.11` is the version of the package.
the `~` means that the package is not stable and the `4.17.11` is the version of the package.
